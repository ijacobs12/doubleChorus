An emulation of the Mr. Black double chorus pedal. The algorithm used is described here:

If you want the plugin, download and unzip the component.zip file (mac) or vst.zip file (windows), and put it in your plugin folder.

The plugin itself is easy to use, and installs like any other VST or Component.
