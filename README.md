An emulation of the Mr. Black double chorus pedal. The algorithm used is described here:

If you want the plugin, click on and download the .component file (mac) or .VST(windows) file

The plugin itself is easy to use, and installs like any other VST or Component plugin (just put it in the corresponding folder in library/audio/plug-ins on a mac and surely something very similar on windows)!

(shoutout to Marc Wilhite, who doesn't know me but has a github project that helped me with getting started: https://github.com/marcwilhite/StereoChorus/blob/master/Source/CustomLookAndFeel.cpp)
